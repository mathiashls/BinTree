# BinTree

The BinTree is a project which implements a movie catalog using many data structures implementation.

This is a nested and amateur project for the class Programation II. Back in that day, I was learning how to program and didn't had any discipline with documentation and code style.

## TO DO

* Review the project scope and rework project documentation
* Rewrite code of the project (improve implementation and coding style)
* Make good and simple unit tests
